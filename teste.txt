In the beginning, there was a silence,
A stillness that stretched across the void,
The kind of quiet that lingers after rain,
Soft, suspended, like a held breath.
The earth waited, untouched, unspoken,
A canvas yet to feel the brush of life.

And then a whisperâ€”
Not of voice but of wind,
The trees stirring like old hands remembering
Their first touch of sunlight.
The air was new,
Its edges sharp against the dawn,
Every leaf quivering
With the weight of promise.

Time began its slow and patient walk.
The rivers traced their paths,
Their currents learning to sing
The songs of rocks and roots,
Of every bend and ripple.
Mountains rose in quiet defiance,
Solid and sure,
While beneath them, the earth breathed slow,
A heartbeat hidden in the deep,
Ancient and eternal.
